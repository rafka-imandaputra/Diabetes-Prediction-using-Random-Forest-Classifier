# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Several-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This is the source code that I use to predict whether someone has diabetes or not. The dataset I'm using is from here https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.html  The accuracy of this model is around 92% with an AUC of 0.94, this model is made using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm with several tuning parameters. This source code includes Exploratory Data Analysis in it.  Please open the GitHub Pages page if you want to see it, or you can download the ipynb file. both are the same
