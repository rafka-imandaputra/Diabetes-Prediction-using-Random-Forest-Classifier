# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Classiier
<p>This is the source code that I use to predict whether someone has diabetes or not. The dataset I'm using is from here https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.html</p> 
<p>The accuracy of this model is around 92% with an AUC of 0.94, this model is made using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm with several tuning parameters. This source code includes Exploratory Data Analysis in it.</p>  
<p>Please open the GitHub Pages page if you want to see it, or you can download the ipynb file. both are the same.</p>
